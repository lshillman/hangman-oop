## Installation

If you've installed Node and NPM, just clone the repo down, cd into the directory, and run npm install. This app uses inquirer to collect guesses and jest for unit tests (if you aren't going to run the unit tests, feel free to skip installing jest).

## Usage

Run 'node index.js' from your terminal and you'll be off to the races. The game will restart after every win or loss.

## Contributing

You're more than welcome to send a PR if you improve this; particularly if you'd like to write a web frontend for it!

## Tests

Jest unit tests are included for the Letter and Word classes.
